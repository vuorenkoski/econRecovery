# Some scripts for downloading economical data

These are for downloading data and to convert them in csv format: worldBank.ipynb, imf.ipynb and covid.ipynb. These scripts create local csv files. 

Notebook view_combined_data.ipnyb uses these csv files combined.

imf_rawdata folder includes data downloaded manually from IMF in excel format.
